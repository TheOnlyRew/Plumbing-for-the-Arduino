Servo Chapter 4 - Well, It's Mostly working...
	We have some code that will swing that servo in an arch. There is no doubt about that. We also have some code that pretty beautifully crashes after about a two seconds of running. Again, this is in no way bad for your Arduino, but we should probably try to find out what's causing it and, well... Fix it.

GOALS
	1 To build a few tools for helping us find and fix bug is our code
	2 Explore why exactly the code we've been working with broke
	3 Take another look at WHILE loops to see how we can write one that doesn't keep going indefinitely.

THE CIRCUT
	Same circut as we've been using. Again, have a pretty picture.

THE CODE
	Well, what we're actually going to be looking at first is the broken.
	When we run the code we drafted up last chapter, everything goes smoothly untill the servo gets to one of its extreems, then the servo stops moving, and [[A THING HAPPENS HERE WITH JEDIT OR WHATEVER WITH AN ERROR SHOWING UP]]
		[[A PICTURE OF THE ERROR!!]]

	This is, as you might have been able to deduce, and error message. Let's take a look at it [[WHEN DREW IS ACTUALLY LOOKING AT THE ERROR MESSAGE AND CAN PULL IMPORTANT BITS OUT
